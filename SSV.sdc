# SDRAM interface (single 64Mx16 module on GPIO0, CL2, clk_ram
# 96.648 MHz, SDRAM_CLK forwarded from PLL outclk2 at 180 deg)
#
# Until this block existed the SDRAM bus was COMPLETELY
# unconstrained: SDRAM_CLK had no clock, so no DQ capture path
# was ever analysed and STA reported "met" while saying nothing
# about the read path.  Precedent for constraining it this way
# is the sibling Sega System 32 core,
#   D:\Arcade\AI\s32\Arcade-SegaSystem32.sdc lines 23-52,
# which has an identical topology (outclk0 = clk_ram 96.63 MHz,
# outclk2 = SDRAM_CLK at 180 deg, CL2, same DE10-Nano module),
# and D:\Arcade\AI\aCORES\Sega Y Board\Arcade-SegaYBoard.sdc
# lines 4-17 which carries the same four delay numbers.
#
# Honest note on "common practice": most MiSTer cores do NOT
# constrain SDRAM at all -- not even false-path it.  sys/sys_top.sdc
# here, Template.sdc, Arcade-IremM92.sdc, Arcade-MrDo.sdc,
# Arcade-YellowCab.sdc and Ikki.sdc contain zero SDRAM references.
# The jtframe framework
#   D:\Arcade\AI\aCORES\Sega Y Board\third_party\jtcores\modules\
#   jtframe\target\mister\syn\sdram_clk96.sdc
# creates the SDRAM_CLK generated clock and the same read-capture
# multicycle exception, but supplies no set_input_delay /
# set_output_delay at all.  So the generated clock + multicycle
# pair is established practice; the I/O delay values below are
# only precedented by the two sibling cores above.
